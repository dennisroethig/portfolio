			<h4>
				Thanks for stopping by!
			</h4>
			<p>
				My name is Dennis and I'm a front-end developer from Germany.
				Currently I am living and working in Melbourne, Australia.
				Since 2008 I'm trying to make the web a better place and I'm enjoying every bit of it.
				In doing so I am also growing my own skills.
			</p>

			<p>
				A bit of history: After my studies I moved to Berlin and helped a start-up to become Europe's first location-based ad network.
				Then, in summer 2012, I decided to move down under and take up a new challenge.
			</p>

			<p>
				Until February 2014 I helped <a href="http://www.reactive.com" target="_blank">Reactive</a>&nbsp;- one of Australia's biggest digital agencies - to tackle their development challenges.
				I'm excited to be a part of the <a href="http://www.99designs.com" target="_blank">99designs</a>&nbsp;team from March on and look forward to all the new challenges!
			</p>

			<p>If you want to have a chat or tell me about an exciting project, Iâ€™d love to hear from you.</p>
